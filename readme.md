<h2>"Is automatic speech-to-text transcription ready for use in psychological experiments?"</h2>

This repository contains the free recall data and Python code necessary to generate the figures in our [publication](https://psyarxiv.com/psh48/) on the merits of using automatic speech to text software in the context of psychological experiments. 

Please also see our in-house Python package, [Quail](https://github.com/ContextLab/quail), used for figure generation, and the code for our [free recall experiment](https://github.com/ContextLab/autoFR).

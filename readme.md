<h2>"Is automatic speech-to-text transcription ready for use in psychological experiments?"</h2>

This repository contains the free recall data and Python code necessary to generate the figures in our [publication](https://psyarxiv.com/psh48/) on the merits of using automatic speech to text software in the context of psychological experiments. 

The data is stored in pickle files in  the data directory (separate transcription and onset time files), and code for analyses is stored in separate Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory. 

Please also see our in-house Python package, [Quail](https://github.com/ContextLab/quail), used for figure generation, and the code for our [free recall experiment](https://github.com/ContextLab/autoFR).

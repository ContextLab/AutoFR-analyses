This repository contains the free recall data and Python code necessary to generate the figures in our publication "Is automatic speech-to-text transcription ready for use in psychological experiments?", found here : https://psyarxiv.com/psh48/

The data is stored in pickle files in  the data directory (separate transcription and onset time files), and code for analyses is stored in separate Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory. 

Our in-house Python package, Quail, used for figure generation, can be found here: https://github.com/ContextLab/quail

And the free recall experiment code can be found here: https://github.com/ContextLab/autoFR

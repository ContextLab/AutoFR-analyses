This repository contains the data (that is, the manual and automatic transcriptions and recall onset times from a free recall experiment) and code (contained in jupyter notebooks) necessary to generate the figures in our publication "Is automatic speech-to-text transcription ready for use in psychological experiments?", found here : https://psyarxiv.com/psh48/

Our in-house Python package, Quail, used for figure generation, can be found here: https://github.com/ContextLab/quail

And the experiment code can be found here: https://github.com/ContextLab/autoFR
